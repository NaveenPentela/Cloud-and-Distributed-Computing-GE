# Project Details

**LEARNING OUTCOME**
The objective of this project is to test your knowledge and skills learned through laboratory exercises
where you used a cloud platform (PaaS) and Node-RED (node.js) run-time. After the completion of this
assessment task, you will understand the need for cloud and enterprise computing and cloud services.
On successful completion of this assignment, you will be able to
• Analyse the performance metrics of cloud deployment models for a use case,
• Evaluate and assess the business and technical benefits of cloud computing for a real-world use case,
• Design and deploy a cloud solution for a real-world use case over a public cloud platform, and
• Research and critically evaluate emerging trends, solutions and issues in cloud computing.


# APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT Outline
Work in your groups and develop a solution for an industry problem (which you selected in Week 2), using
the Node-RED development environment. Node-RED is a visual and wiring tool that connects IoT and edge
computing systems, such as industrial automation controllers to cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services
IoT, IBM Watson IoT, Microsoft Azure, and NeCTAR. The Node-RED development environment simply
builds the actual solution using a web browser and a drag-and-drop interface without creating the components of the application from scratch. In fact, Node-RED requires little to no programming skills and it has a steep learning curve for all users with different knowledge and experience levels.
IBM has many Node-red tutorials on its developer website https://developer.ibm.com/components/node-red/tutorials/.
For seeing the examples of such applications, you can explore and use any of the following online Node-RED
tutorials and examples provided below:

• Watson’s Node-RED services basic examples https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-red-labs/
blob/master/basic_examples/README.md

• Watson’s Node-RED advanced examples https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-red-labs/
tree/master/advanced_examples

• Use Watson’s Natural Language Understanding to analyse news articles https://github.com/IBM/

• Generating data for anomaly detection https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/iot-deep-learning-anomaly-det?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=deep%20learning%20%20red%20flow

• Build a low-code chatbot and movie recommender solution using Watson Services and Node-RED
https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/build-a-low-code-chatbot-and-movie-recommender-solution-usin?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=deep%20learning%20%20red%20flow

• A set of Node-RED nodes to access various Google services https://flows.nodered.org/node/
node-red-node-google

# Requirements:
(1) You Node-RED flow (application) must use at least three cloud API services.
(2) The Node-RED flow must contain (be connected to) a web application within
• the Google Cloud Platform or
• the IBM cloud environment or
• any other cloud services such as Microsoft or Amazon.
(3) The web application provides a practical solution to business problems using Node-RED technology
(node.js) and various cloud services, for example, IBM Watson.
(4) Node-RED flow must have real business applicability and functionality.
(5) Real business applicability and functionality must be supported by some evidence, for example,
statistics or information supported by references.
(6) The Node-RED flow must be more advanced than the flows you have generated in your laboratory
exercises and it cannot be the same as the examples given above or your laboratory exercises.
(7) The Node-RED flow must have at least three function nodes with JavaScript code.
